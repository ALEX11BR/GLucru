# A little Chrome dino game clone made using SFML

This is a project I made back in the days when I was younger and less experienced at programming.
It was made on June 19th, 2019, from morning until early evening, during a time I had no internet access.

In the original project I put the `.ttf` files of the Arial font, which is copyrighted, so in the version uploaded here I removed the said files and instead put the Liberation Sans v2 one.

The game is quite simple, it has ~100 lines of code in `main.cpp`, with some comments in Romanian (and quite awful naming and spacing), as it was intended to be a demo of how to program games to my peers in the camp I was in.
The project was made using CodeBlocks, as it was the main programming environment I knew about and used.

## Binaries
- __Windows__: `bin/Debug/GLucru.exe`, with the `.dll`s in the base directory.
- __Linux__: `./glucru`, with system-provided `libsfml-graphics.so.2.5`, `libsfml-system.so.2.5`, `libsfml-window.so.2.5`.
